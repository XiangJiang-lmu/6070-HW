# This is my ML CA01
# There are 3 parts in my ipynb
# First part is about data exploration and data visualization, I used some fuctions like info() to check the stastistics information and misssing values, also I created new table to present count, Na and nunique values to check outliers, then I used AV.AutoViz to make all variables with oitliers visualization.
# I found out these variables from visualization, and I drew plots like hisgram, scatter to compare the relationship of univariate, bivariate and multivariate. then the headmap and the scatter plot with all variables help me to present all correlation for variables
# From part 2, I cleaned all missing values and these outlier from the variables with my visualition presenting.
# In ths last part, I also use scatter plot, histgram, boxplot and headmap to present  new correlation and what is the change after I processed.
